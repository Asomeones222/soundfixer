# SoundFixer [![unlicense](https://img.shields.io/badge/un-license-green.svg?style=flat)](https://unlicense.org)

![Screenshot](https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/279/279487.png?modified=1677998068)

a WebExtension that lets you fix annoying sound problems on the web (e.g. in YouTube videos): sound in one channel only, too quiet even at maximum volume, too loud even at minimum volume.

[![Mozilla Add-on](https://img.shields.io/amo/users/soundfixer?color=rebeccapurple&logo=firefox&logoColor=white&style=for-the-badge)](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/soundfixer/)

(NOTE: this SoundFixer only exists for Firefox! Anything uploaded to other browsers' extension stores is not mine! Please don't report bugs to me if you use those.)

No more "[Plug your headphones only halfway into the jack](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11912213)" :D

(Unfortunately, doesn't work on all websites â€” specifically, we're not allowed to use the Web Audio API from a cross-domain `<audio>` source. Thankfully, YouTube is not cross-domain!)

(Doesn't seem to work in Chromium/Opera currently because of permission issues. Even when allowing all URLs.)
